ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.gradle
* images/
* images/capabilities_database.png
* images/control_api_extension_lifecycle.png
* images/notification_database.png
* images/notification_operating_environment.png
* images/registration_database.png

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In SmartExtensionAPI:
* AndroidManifest.xml => smartExtensionAPI/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => smartExtensionAPI/src/main/res/
* src/ => smartExtensionAPI/src/main/java/
In SmartExtensionUtils:
* AndroidManifest.xml => smartExtensionUtils/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => smartExtensionUtils/src/main/res/
* src/ => smartExtensionUtils/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
